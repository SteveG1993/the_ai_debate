  "description": "Hi everyone, for those who don’t know me yet - my name is Dr Anastasia Dedyukhina and I run the global network of digital wellbeing coaches Consciously Digital. We work with individuals, families and organizations helping them find a better tech-life balance, improve digital habits and be more conscious about how they use tech. So our focus is on the consumer behaviour.\nWe offer a full 8 months certification in digital wellbeing coaching. (Note - you don’t have to be a coach or work as a full-time coach after the course, we teach you a “coach approach” to behavioural change, which will be useful with any team or organization. Currently applications are open for 2023 intakes until the 1st March.\nDiploma is certified by two major coaching associations, ICF and NBHWC.
