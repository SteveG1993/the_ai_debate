  "description": "Hello, I’m working on my BA for psychology. I was originally interested in individual therapy but I am having second thoughts since 1 on 1 therapy isn’t going to turn the tide against the mass produced addiction and mental illness related to tech. I have been thinking of using my degree in some way related to app and game design that would be healthy. There is a metaverse platform called Zero that has a game in development called Wilder World. Its mission is pro-topian, it has Balaji’s “win and help win” attitude and is advised by Jordan Hall. I’d like to work on stuff like that where it is a game first but has healthy features to it.\nMy question is: What is the best way to research jobs in tech when I am unsure of what the job is? When I do searches for psych jobs in tech the names and descriptions are pretty vague.\n            1 post - 1 participant\n            Read full topic",
